    Modify the previous mousemove program so that instead of
following your mouse, the heading will follow just your clicks.
Whenever you click the page, the heading should move to the
click location.

Use setInterval to animate an h1 heading element around
the page, in a square. It should move 200 pixels to the right,
200 pixels down, 200 pixels to the left, 200 pixels up, and
then start again. Hint: You’ll need to keep track of your
current direction (right, down, left, or up) so that you know
whether to increase or decrease the left or top offset of the
heading. You’ll also need to change the direction when you
reach a corner of the square.

Building upon Challenge #2, add a click handler to the mov-
ing h1 element that cancels the animation. Hint: You can
cancel intervals with the clearInterval function

Modify Challenge #3 so that every time a player clicks the
heading, instead of stopping, the heading speeds up, making
it harder and harder to click. Keep track of the number of
times the heading has been clicked and update the heading
text so it shows this number. When the player has reached
10 clicks, stop the animation and change the text of the
heading to “You Win.” Hint: To speed up, you’ll have to
cancel the current interval and then start a new one with
a shorter interval time.
